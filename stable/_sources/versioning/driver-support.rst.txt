Driver Support
========================

Support Policy
----------------

We support the **two most recent minor releases** of :doc:`ScyllaDB drivers </drivers/cql-drivers/>`.

* We test and validate the latest two minor versions.
* We typically patch only the latest minor release.

We recommend staying up to date with the latest supported versions to receive
updates and fixes.

At a minimum, upgrade your driver when upgrading to a new ScyllaDB version
to ensure compatibility between the driver and the database.
